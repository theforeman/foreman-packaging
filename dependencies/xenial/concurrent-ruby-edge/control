Description: Edge features and additions to the concurrent-ruby gem.
 These features are under active development and may change frequently. They are expected not to
 keep backward compatibility (there may also lack tests and documentation). Semantic versions will
 be obeyed though. Features developed in `concurrent-ruby-edge` are expected to move to `concurrent-ruby` when final.
 Please see http://concurrent-ruby.com for more information.
