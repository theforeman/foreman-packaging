Description: Systems management web interface
 Foreman is aimed to be a single address for all machines life cycle management.
 .
  - Foreman integrates with Puppet and acts as web front end to it.
  - Foreman takes care of bare bone provisioning until the point puppet is
    running, allowing Puppet to do what it does best.
  - Foreman shows you Systems Inventory (based on Facter) and provides real time
    information about hosts status based on Puppet reports.
  - Foreman creates everything you need when adding a new machine to your
    network. Its goal being automatically managing everything you would
    normally manage manually - that would eventually include DNS, DHCP,
    TFTP, PuppetCA, CMDB and everything else you might consider useful.
  - With Foreman you can always rebuild your machines from scratch.
  - Foreman is designed to work in a large enterprise, where multiple domains,
    subnets and puppetmasters are required.
    In many cases, Foreman could help remote provisions where no experienced
    technicians are available.
