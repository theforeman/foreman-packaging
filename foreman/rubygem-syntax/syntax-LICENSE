Lubomir,

The syntax gem that I wrote is no longer being maintained, and has
been wholly deprecated in favor of the (much nicer) CodeRay library
(http://coderay.rubychan.de/).

That said, if you are still interested in packaging the syntax gem,
you may use this email as notice of it's being placed in the public
domain.

"The syntax library is hereby placed into the public domain by its
author, Jamis Buck."
